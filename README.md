## Description

The Melvor Map Maker is an interactive tool designed to take the heavy lifting of creating a new map for the Cartography skill in Melvor Idle off your shoulders. You can go try it out [here](https://draedon123.github.io/Melvor-Map-Maker/). This tool takes care of many things for you, from creating supercompressed .basis files from your image files, to bundling everything up in a zip file ready for uploading to mod.io. Seasoned mod developers can even take the exported zip file and add their own custom changes to it, or even incorporate it into their own larger mod.

## Disclaimer

As of the present, the Melvor Map Maker is an **unofficial** tool and is **not** endorsed by Melvor Idle or Games by Malcs in any way, shape or form.
